# An NMEA / AIS / AIVDO message generator

This was developed as a means to generate AIS messages from DIS simulation data and to display this data in OpenCPN.
This was not a priority during development and as such was developed in quite a hacky fashion. That beeing said, it seems to work quite well and is to my knowledge currently the only AIS message generator in the entire internet.


# Supported message types

This supports the generation of "Position Report Class A" messages, also known as type 1/2/3:

And "Static and Voyage Related Data" or Type 5:
https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/AIVDM.html#_type_5_static_and_voyage_related_data


## Credit / Acknowledgements

- All of this was developed based on the knowledge gathered from [Eric S. Raymonds "AIVDM/AIVDO protocol decoding" article](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/AIVDM.html) 
- The checksum calculation is done with [pynmeagps](https://pypi.org/project/pynmeagps/)
- The verification of the results seen in the usage examples is done with the help of [pyais](https://pypi.org/project/pyais/)


## Installation

- Clone this repo
- open the cloned folder in your terminal
- run
```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

```python
# Used to verify the resulting NMEA message
import pyais

# https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/AIVDM.html#_types_1_2_and_3_position_report_class_a
# Type 1/2/3 message:
import ais_nmea_message_position_report

message = ais_nmea_message_position_report.NmeaMessage.create_NMEA(mmsi=1234, lat=26.46, lon=19.27, speed=11.67,
                                                                   heading=155.55)
print(message)

# Verification:
print(pyais.decode_msg(message))

print("\n---------------------------------------------\n")

# https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/AIVDM.html#_type_5_static_and_voyage_related_data
# Type 5 message:

                                                                     ship_type=0,
                                                                     destination="Mallorca",
                                                                     draught=10)
print(message)

# Verification:
print(pyais.decode_msg(message))
```


## ToDo / Roadmaps

There are currently no plans to develop this further
